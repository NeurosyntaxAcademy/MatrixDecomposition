**Matrix Decomposition Tutorial Series - Neurosyntax Academy**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Matrix Decomposition" tutorial series, hosted by Neurosyntax Academy. Recorded during the summer of 2024, this series is designed to delve into the complex world of linear methods that are fundamental in extracting patterns from high-dimensional data.

**Overview**
In this series, I explore the mathematical formalisms, core concepts, critical inferences, underlying assumptions, and limitations associated with these powerful techniques. While many examples are drawn from genetics and neuroscience, the principles discussed are universally applicable across all scientific fields. The primary aim is to provide a thorough understanding that aids researchers and enthusiasts in applying these methods effectively in their own areas of study.

**Contents**
This repository contains:

Source Codes: MATLAB scripts and functions demonstrated in the tutorials.

Datasets: Sample data used throughout the series to illustrate concepts.

PowerPoint Slides: Detailed presentations in English, packed with relevant citations for each technique and notes on related toolboxes.

Tutorials on YouTube (in Persian)
The video tutorials are available in Persian and can be accessed through the following YouTube playlist:
